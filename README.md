# Bio

## Career

I have 9+ years of professional software development experience, and 2+ years of leading engineering teams. My development experience is split across Fullstack web development, game development, and iOS and Android app development. I currently provide consultation on engineering, engineering management, remote work, and scaling engineering teams.

## Who I am

### Goals and Principles

I always aim to do things in a right way (because there is no one right way) that fits our needs and with foresight for future growth, I consistently strive to do everything practically, at an extremely high quality, and with honesty and transparency.

I am a constant improver, I'll always aim to maximize our utilization of anything we use, and to improve upon existing tools and processes. I try to make sure people around me are doing what **they** believe is right.

I apply these principles in every aspect of my career (whether it's software, management, or any part of my job) and life, especially when dealing with things that are new to me. I am very glad to do things that push me out of my comfort zone.

I am always extremely thankful to every one who helped me to get here and to continue moving forward, and I love to meet new awesome people and help out wherever I can.

Last but not least, I want to make sure that whatever I build adds value to people, either by giving them some joy and fun through games I make, or enhancing and enriching their lives through software.

### Hobbies

I am quite a geek. I am a gamer (PC and consoles), sci-fi (Dune, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.) and fantasy lover through books (Wheel of Time, Mistborn, Shannara, etc.), games (Hardcore gamer since the 90s, love MMOs), movies, shows, or whatever medium available. I am also very into anime, manga, and manhwa and I'm currently learning Japanese :)
